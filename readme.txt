== Description ==

Woocommerce Add Countries is a lightweight plugin which allows you to add new countries to the Woocommerce countries list.
This plugin is useful if you want to add a new country to the Woocommerce countries list, or if you need to divide a country into different zones to have a different shipping cost for each one.

Let's say, for example, that you have different shipping costs for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Woocommerce you will only find United Kingdom. With "Woocommerce Add Countries" you can easily add the following countries to the list from the plugin's settings page:

`ENG, England
SCT, Scotland
WLS, Wales
NIR, Northern Ireland`

FOr a complete list of country codes defined in ISO 3166 standard take a look here: [ISO CODES - Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
